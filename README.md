International Forestry Law Infographic
==================================================

This infographic shows which countries are signatory to which international agreements and laws related to forestry governance. 

It's adapted from code made for the [HBO recycling project](https://github.com/zgrossbart/hborecycling), which is fun. 

It's made with [PaperJS](http://www.paperjs.org), [underscore.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore), and a little [JQuery](http://www.jquery.com) with fonts from [Typekit](http://typekit.com).
